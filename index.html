                        <h2>Mission</h2>
                        <p><b>Swami Vivekananda</b> established the Ramakrishna Mission to propagate the ideals of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. It aimed at working for one’s liberation as well as working for the welfare of the whole world. Ever since its inception, the mission has been acting as a catalyst in the regeneration of human spirituality without emphasizing on a specific religion. It is a non-political and non-religious organization trying to unite all religions and provide selfless service to humanity.
                            The mission was started in 1897, at Belur Math near Calcutta. The organization was initially conceived as a brotherhood, but soon it took the shape that it was meant for. The two main objectives of renunciation and service were propounded by Sri Ramakrishna which Swami Vivekananda desired to spread to the world.
                            In its latter years, the mission also gave rise to two new organizations called the Ramakrishna Mutt and Ramakrishna Mission. The Mutt is concerned with renunciation and for self-emancipation. The Mission is meant for social service.</p>

                        <h2>Biography</h2>
                        <p><b>Vivekananda</b>, original name <b>Narendranath Datta</b>, Datta also spelled Dutt, <b>(born January 12, 1863, Calcutta [now Kolkata]—died July 4, 1902, near Calcutta)</b>, Hindu spiritual leader and reformer in India who attempted to combine Indian spirituality with Western material progress, maintaining that the two supplemented and complemented one another. His Absolute was a person’s own higher self; to labour for the benefit of humanity was the noblest endeavour.Born into an upper-middle-class family of the Kayastha (scribes) caste in Bengal, he was educated at a Western-style university where he was exposed to Western philosophy, Christianity, and science. Social reform became a prominent element of <b>Vivekananda’s</b> thought, and he joined the Brahmo Samaj (Society of Brahma), dedicated to eliminating child marriage and illiteracy and determined to spread education among women and the lower castes. He later became the most-notable disciple of <b>Ramakrishna</b>, who demonstrated the essential unity of all religions.</p>
